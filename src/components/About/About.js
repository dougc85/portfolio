        <p>
          <span>
            Welcome!  My name is Doug, and I am a full-stack web developer based in Los Angeles.
            I have been building up experience as a developer for the past few years after a two decade run
            as a local jazz pianist.

          <span>
            In my development work, I get most excited thinking about how to design applications that
            encourage people to use their many devices less, how to design apps that provide a service and then
            lead users back into the world. To that end, developing great user experiences and designing
            with simplicity in mind are both paramount in my work.
          </span>
          <span>
            Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy having a look around.
